I'm Muhammad **Hilmi** Asyrofi, a Machine Learning Enthusiast from Indonesia. I received my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science (Cum Laude) from Institut Teknologi Bandung ([The Best University in Indonesia](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2021/subject-ranking/computer-science#!/page/0/length/25/locations/ID/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats))

Currently, I'm working in Singapore as a Research Engineer at [SCIS SMU](https://scis.smu.edu.sg). I'm very fortunate to be advised by [ACM Distinguished Scientist Prof. David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/)
